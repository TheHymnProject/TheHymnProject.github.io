Ps 96:1-2, 5-6, 9

R. The Lord is king, the most high over all the earth.

The Lord is king, let earth rejoice,
let all the coastlands be glad.
Cloud and darkness are his raiment;
his throne, justice and right. R.

The mountains melt like wax
before the Lord of all the earth.
The skies proclaim his justice;
all peoples see he glory. R.

For you indeed are the Lord
most high above all the earth
exalted far above all spirits. R.
