R. I will sing of your salvation.



In you, O Lord, I take refuge;

let me never be put to shame.

in your justice rescue me, free me:

pay heed to me and save me. R.



Be a rock where I can take refuge,

a mighty stronghold to save me;

for you are my rock, my stronghold.

Free me from the hand of the wicked. R.



It is you, O Lord, who are my hope,

my trust, O Lord, since my youth.

On you I have leaned from my birth,

from my mother's womb you have been my help. R.



My lips will tell of your justice

and day by day of your help.

O God, you have taught me from my youth

and I proclaim your wonders still. R.
