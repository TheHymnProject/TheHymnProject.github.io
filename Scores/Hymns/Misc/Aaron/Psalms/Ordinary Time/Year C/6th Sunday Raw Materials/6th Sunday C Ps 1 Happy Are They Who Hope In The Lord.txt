R. Happy are they who hope in the Lord.



Happy indeed is the man

who follows not the counsel of the wicked;

nor lingers in the way of sinners

nor sits in the company of scorners,

but whose delight is the law of the Lord

and who ponders his law day and night. R.



He is like a tree that is planted

beside the flowing waters,

that yields its fruit in due season

and whose leaves shall never fade;

and all that he does shall prosper. R.



Not so are the wicked, not so!

For they like winnowed chaff

shall be driven away by the wind.

For the Lord guards the way of the just

but the way of the wicked leads to doom. R.
