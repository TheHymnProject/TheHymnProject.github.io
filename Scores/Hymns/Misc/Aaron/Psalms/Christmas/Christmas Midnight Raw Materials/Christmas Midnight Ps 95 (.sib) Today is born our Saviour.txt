R. Today is born our Saviour, Christ the Lord.

O sing a new song to the Lord,
sing to the Lord all the earth.
O sing to the Lord, bless his name. R.

Proclaim his help day by day,
tell among the nations his glory
and his wonders among all the peoples. R.

Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad,
let the sea and all within it thunder praise,
let the land and all it bears rejoice,
all the trees of the wood shout for joy
at the presence of the Lord for he comes,
he comes to rule the earth. R.

With justice he will rule the world,
he will judge the peoples with his truth. R.
